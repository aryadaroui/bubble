# Bubble

A VS Code theme with the goal of using as many meaningful colors as possible for Python and C syntax highlighting, but works fine for other languages too. Inspired by the colorful iridescence on the thin film of bubbles. A bit more info available [here](https://aryadaroui.github.io/2022/03/29/bubble-dark.html).
